Your challenge is to build an app that forecasts air quality by integrating real-time TEMPO data with ground-based air quality measurements and weather data, and that helps people limit their exposure to unhealthy levels of air pollution by showing them local air quality predictions and sending timely alerts. Your tool could help improve public health and environmental awareness by using NASA's Earth information in a way that's easy to understand, freely available, and reliable!

Think about how your app could bring together different types of information—from satellites in space, sensors on the ground, and weather data—including the new TEMPO satellite data and possibly measurements from networks like Pandora or OpenAQ (see Resources tab). The app could combine all this information to create useful local air quality forecasts with clear visualizations that may include landscape features of the area. Users could get alerts when air quality might affect their health. The app could work with different data sources and clearly show where the information comes from.

What capabilities will you include in your app? There are so many possibilities! For example, your app could:

Display and integrate data from diverse sources
Near real-time TEMPO data (check and make sure you use the latest product!)
Ground-based air quality measurements (e.g., Pandora, TolNet, OpenAQ—see Resources tab)
Weather data
Compare satellite data with ground station data for validation purposes in real time
Generate forecasts of local air quality
Visualize complex information clearly to users
Alert users proactively about potential health risks related to air quality
Provide historical trends of variables
Whatever capabilities your app offers, don’t forget to incorporate user-centric design and preferences (e.g., for specific audiences or geographic regions). Get creative! What kind of novel visualizations will your app display? You could also include supplementary datasets (e.g., respiratory health data, etc.) that could increase the value of your app for additional communities or markets. And remember to cite the specific data and tools used in your app!

Potential Considerations
Your project could address target stakeholders affected by air quality concerns including (but not limited to):

Health-Sensitive Groups:

Residents in industrial zones facing heightened exposure
Policy Implementation Partners:
Government officials and municipal leaders enacting clean air initiatives
Transportation authorities (managing transit systems, ports, aviation, traffic flows)
Parks departments, recreation coordinators, and athletic trainers/directors
School district environmental health officers and athletic trainers/directors (making decisions about outdoor activities for student athletes)
Tourism boards optimizing visitor experiences and regional appeal
Emergency Response Networks:
Wildfire management teams
Disaster readiness organizations
Meteorological service providers
Crisis communication specialists
Economic Stakeholders:
Insurance risk assessors evaluating health and property implications
Public Engagement:
Citizen science coordinators mobilizing community-based data collection
